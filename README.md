# CoH2AutoFarm
A tiny tool for Company of Heroes 2 auto looting.

~The syntax used in this little project is AHK v1, migration to AHK v2 is still
on the way.~

All right, it seems that the schedule is tight and time is limited, the migration
work won't be continued. Anyway you can always use AHKv2 to run the script and 
make it download the v1 core automatically.

 - Based on AutoHotKey. you can either use the script or download the binary.
 - Requires CheatCommands Mod II to function, you have to manually switch the
custom game win condition to "CheatCommands Mod II (Annih.)", a 4v4 map is also
needed.
 - Tested under resolution 1366\*768 window mode, use Alt + Enter to activate.
 - Start at the title screen, press F3 to activate this script.
 - Due to looting limits the script only brings at most 4 lootbox per day.
