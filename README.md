# CoH2AutoFarm
A tiny tool for Company of Heroes 2 auto looting.

The syntax used in this little project is AHK v1, migration to AHK v2 is still
on the way.

 - Based on AutoHotKey. you can either use the script or download the binary.
 - Requires CheatCommands Mod II to function, you have to manually switch the
custom game win condition to "CheatCommands Mod II (Annih.)", a 4v4 map is also
needed.
 - Tested under resolution 1366\*768 window mode, use Alt + Enter to activate.
 - Start at the title screen, press F3 to activate this script.
 - Due to looting limits the script only brings at most 4 lootbox per day.
